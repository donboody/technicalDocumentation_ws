                        What is Flutter?

                    <p>
                        Flutter is a mobile app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and
                        Android,
                        from a
                        single codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on
                        different
                        platforms.
                        We embrace differences in scrolling behaviors, typography, icons, and more.

                        No mobile development experience is required to get started. Apps are written in Dart, which
                        looks
                        familiar
                        if you’ve used a language like Java or JavaScript. Experience with object-oriented languages is
                        definitely
                        helpful, but even non-programmers have made Flutter apps!

                        Core principles
                    </header>
                    <p>Flutter includes a modern react-style framework, a 2D rendering engine, ready-made widgets, and
                        development
                        tools. These components work together to help you design, build, test, and debug apps.
                        Everything is
                        organized around a few core principles.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-head-l1">
                        Everything's a Widget
                    </p>
                    <p>Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app’s user interface. Each widget is an
                        immutable
                        declaration of part of the user interface. Unlike other frameworks that separate views, view
                        controllers,
                        layouts, and other properties, Flutter has a consistent, unified object model: the widget.</p>
                    <p>A widget can define:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a structural element (like a button or menu)</li>
                        <li>a stylistic element (like a font or color scheme)</li>
                        <li>an aspect of layout (like padding)</li>
                        <li>and so on…</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Widgets form a hierarchy based on composition. Each widget nests inside, and inherits properties
                        from,
                        its
                        parent. There is no separate “application” object. Instead, the root widget serves this role.</p>
                    <p>You can respond to events, like user interaction, by telling the framework to replace a widget
                        in the
                        hierarchy with another widget. The framework then compares the new and old widgets and
                        efficiently
                        updates
                        the user interface.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-head-l2">
                        Composition > inheritance
                    </p>
                    <p>Widgets are themselves often composed of many small, single-purpose widgets that combine to
                        produce
                        powerful
                        effects. For example, <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/container.dart"
                            target="_blank">Container</a>, a commonly-used widget, is made up of several widgets
                        responsible
                        for
                        layout, painting, positioning, and sizing. Specifically, Container is made up of <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/LimitedBox-class.html"
                            target="_blank">LimitedBox</a>,
                        <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ConstrainedBox-class.html" target="_blank">ConstrainedBox</a>,
                        <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Align-class.html" target="_blank">Align</a>,
                        <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html" target="_blank">Padding</a>,
                        <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/DecoratedBox-class.html" target="_blank">DecoratedBox</a>,
                        and <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Transform-class.html" target="_blank">Transform</a>
                        widgets. Rather than subclassing Container
                        to
                        produce a customized effect, you can compose these, and other, simple widgets in novel ways.</p>
                    <p>The class hierarchy is shallow and broad to maximize the possible number of combinations.</p>

                    <img class="image-1" src="http://i63.tinypic.com/2igbwk8.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>

                    <p>You can also control the <em>layout</em> of a widget by composing it with other widgets. For
                        example, to
                        center a
                        widget, you wrap it in a Center widget. There are widgets for padding, alignment, row, columns,
                        and
                        grids.
                        These layout widgets do not have a visual representation of their own. Instead, their sole
                        purpose is
                        to
                        control some aspect of another widget’s layout. To understand why a widget renders in a certain
                        way,
                        it’s
                        often helpful to inspect the neighboring widgets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-head-l2">
                        Layer cakes are delicious
                    </p>
                    <p>The Flutter framework is organized into a series of layers, with each layer building upon the
                        previous
                        layer.</p>

                    <img class="image-2" src="http://i68.tinypic.com/25fk48n.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>

                    <p>The upper layers of the framework are used more frequently than the lower layers. For the
                        complete set
                        of
                        libraries that make up the Flutter’s layered framework, see our <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/"
                            target="_blank">API documentation</a>.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this design is to help you do more with less code. For example, the Material layer
                        is built
                        by
                        composing basic widgets from the widgets layer, and the widgets layer itself is built by
                        orchestrating
                        lower-level objects from the rendering layer.</p>

                    <p>The layers offer many options for building apps. Choose a customized approach to unlock the full
                        expressive
                        power of the framework, or use building blocks from the widgets layer, or mix and match. You
                        can
                        compose
                        the ready-made widgets Flutter provides, or create your own custom widgets using the same tools
                        and
                        techniques that the Flutter team used to build the framework.</p>

                    <p>Nothing is hidden from you. You reap the productivity benefits of a high-level, unified widget
                        concept,
                        without sacrificing the ability to dive as deeply as you wish into the lower layers.

                    <p>You define the unique characteristics of a widget by implementing a <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html"
                            target="_blank">build</a> function that returns a tree
                        (or
                        hierarchy) of widgets. </p>
                    <p class="sub-head-l3">Build function implementation:</p>
                    <div class="code-div">

Widget build(BuildContext context);</pre>
                        </code>

                    </div>
                    <p>This tree represents the widget’s part of the user interface in more concrete
                        terms.
                        For example, a toolbar widget might have a build function that returns a <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html"
                            target="_blank">horizontal layout</a> of some <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html"
                            target="_blank">text</a>
                        and

                        <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/PopupMenuButton-class.html" target="_blank">buttons</a>.</p>
                    <p class="sub-head-l3">Example:</p>
                    <div class="code-div">
                        <code>

    );
}</pre>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>The framework then recursively asks each of these widgets to build until the process
                        bottoms out in <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectWidget-class.html"
                            target="_blank">fully
                            concrete widgets</a>, which the framework then stitches together into a tree.</p>

                    <p>A widget’s build function should be free of side effects. Whenever it is asked to build, the
                        widget
                        should
                        return a new tree of widgets regardless of what the widget previously returned. The framework
                        does the
                        heavily lifting of comparing the previous build with the current build and determining what
                        modifications
                        need to be made to the user interface.</p>

                    <p>This automated comparison is quite effective, enabling high-performance, interactive apps. And
                        the
                        design of
                        the build function simplifies your code by focusing on declaring what a widget is made of,
                        rather than
                        the
                        complexities of updating the user interface from one state to another.

                    </header>
                    <p>If the unique characteristics of a widget need to change based on user interaction or other
                        factors,
                        that
                        widget is <em>stateful</em>. For example, if a widget has a counter that increments whenever
                        the user
                        taps
                        a button,
                        the value of the counter is the state for that widget. When that value changes, the widget
                        needs to be
                        rebuilt to update the UI.</p>
                    <p>
                        These widgets subclass <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html"

                            target="_blank">StatelessWidget</a>) and store their mutable state in a

                    <p>Whenever you mutate a State object (e.g., increment the counter), you must call <a href="https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html"
                            target="_blank">setState()</a> to signal the
                        framework to update the user interface by calling the State’s build method again. For an
                        example of
                        managing state, see the <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter_tools/templates/app/lib/main.dart.tmpl"

                    <p>Having separate state and widget objects lets other widgets treat stateless and stateful widgets
                        in the
                        same
                        way, without being concerned about losing state. Rather than needing to hold on to a child to
                        preserve
                        its
                        state, the parent is free to create a new instance of the child without losing the child’s
                        persistent
                        state. The framework does all the work of finding and reusing existing state objects when
                        appropriate.
